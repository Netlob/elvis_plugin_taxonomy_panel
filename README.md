This plugin makes use of an txt file inside the `data/elvis/config/taxonomies/` folder. By default that file is `custom-tags-list.txt`. If you would like to change that file, you may want to update the default value of the file used in the panel plugin. Go to the `index.html` file of this plugin and change the path variable on line 15.
